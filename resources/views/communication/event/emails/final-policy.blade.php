        Remember when we mentioned at closing that the title to your property is insured and a policy would come to you after closing? With everything going on, we are guessing not, but that’s okay…we remembered! 
    </p>
    <p class="display-6 fw-lighter my-10">
    Your Owner’s Title Insurance Policy is now available. Make sure to retain this critical policy in your personal records if you ever need to make a claim.

        <button class="btn btn-secondary flex-fill p-8">
            <span class="display-6">Download Your Policy  
            </span>
        </button>
    </div>

    <p class="display-6 fw-lighter my-10">
    NOTE: The link to access your policy will expire in 6 months. Should you ever need a copy and forgot to download it it, we got you covered! You can always reach out to us for another copy.

    <p class="display-6 fw-lighter my-10">
    Congrats again on your purchase and know your title is well protected with Trademark Title!
